    title: The Castle on the Cliff
    description: Taken near Lecce, Italy, 2013. We were driving home from dinner one night and saw this beautiful old castle in a field of wheat and grass. It was the most beautiful thing to behold.

    description: This is a photo of my wife's little sister and her friend, Jeremy, playing at the beach. I loved the feel of it, the motion captured in an instant.

    description: This little guy was on the pier in Avon in 2011, and he struck a little pose for me. I'm a big fan of wildlife photography and I hope to do much more in the future.

    title: Running Down the Aisle
    description: These two were flower girls at a wedding I photographed in 2011. They were rambunctious and ready to run. If you look closely, you'll notice the little one is holding a teething toy in her mouth.
