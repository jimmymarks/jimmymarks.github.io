  - title: Halloween Dad
    tease: My parents divorced when I was six. Irreconcilable differences, or something to that effect. My mom was always a pretty reserved person and my dad was always the more emotional, the more outgoing. It was a day after Christmas that Dad started looking for new apartments…they’d made it through the holiday and he figured time was a-waistin’ and that I’d be too distracted by my GameBoy Color to put up much resistance.

  - title: Spaghetti Mix
    tease: "I was meeting kids who identified as Italian American or Polish or Jewish or “from Philly”. In those years I was defining my own personality and I came to understand a harsh truth about myself and my family: We were Boring Old White People."

  - title: Oh, Good, All of My Mistakes Will Live Forever!
    tease: Oh, the Playstation memory card. This beautiful little chunk of gray plastic meant I’d never suffer the indignity of a lost level again. I could go back and re-load the game at my last save point. I could live forever. So could Gex and Claire Redfield and Crash Bandicoot. I didn’t know it then, but that little card would be the beginning of the end…or, rather, the beginning of the never-ending.

  - title: Build to Last
    tease: "The woodworker labored over his decision for many days. Finally, he contacted the engineer with a simple question: “If I don’t do this for you, who will?” The engineer smiled. “That’s my problem…if you don’t, no one will.”"

  - title: A Piece of American (Alternate) History
    tease: If you're an American, you've seen this image millions of times. A boot print, pressed into the dusty gray soil of the moon, left there for all eternity by the crew of Apollo 11.

  - title: The Six Pen Approach
    tease: If you open up my briefcase on any given day, you'll find six different writing implements that are crucial to my workflow. I'm serious. I do a lot of my work via computer, but there's still a lot of room for analog methods of creativity. I like to keep my writing and drawing muscles strong so that I don't get too reliant on my trusty MacBook.

  - title: To All the Girls I’ve Loved Before (and Their Wives)
    tease: I met Suzanne (real name withheld to protect the innocent) in my high school dual-enrollment calculus classes. She was a very nice girl and she and I got along very well. She was goofy like me, had an odd sense of humor, and she was quick-witted. I thought a lot of her - so much so that I asked her to go to prom with me. She agreed, which was quite a victory for a young, stupid Jimmy Marks.
