  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I’ve been doing web design and development since around 2006. Since then, I’ve worked in a number of interesting fields and for a wide array of companies.</p>

<p>My first ever real-world jobby-job was at <strong>DigitalMailer</strong>, a company that provided email marketing and electronic statements to banks and credit unions. I worked there for six years as the Creative Media Director. In my tenure there, we grew the company exponentially and created a ton of new technology that eventually earned us a few patents.</p>

<p>My next gig was at <strong><a href="science.org">Science Magazine</a></strong>, where I worked with the rest of the Web Technologies team to reinvent the portfolio of products from the ground up and to harmonize the brand across its various web properties. We did great work and launched one of the most ambitious tech undertakings in the foundation’s history.</p>

<p>From there, I went to <strong><a href="https://www.cgi.com/en">CGI</a></strong>, where I worked on apps for the DOD, the Treasury, the EPA, and the West Virgina Deparment of Health and Human Services. I learned a lot about state and federal government there, and a lot about the technology that drives both.</p>

<p>Nowadays, I work for <strong><a href="https://www.trabian.com">Trabian</a></strong>, an awesome shop that specializes in websites and apps for banks of all sizes. We’ve undergone several expansions in the last year or so and we’re growing more every day. We even have our own theme song, which I wrote. I’ll let you hear it if you ask nicely.</p>
