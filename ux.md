Here are some representative examples of user experience design, including content strategy and documentation, and some of my reflections on each piece.

## Wireframing, design and implementation

I recently found a series of wireframes that were iterated upon, one after another, until they fit the business needs as defined by the stakeholders ([1](../files/wireframeiteration1.jpg)\|[2](../files/wireframeiteration2.jpg)\|[3](../files/wireframeiteration3.jpg)\|[4](../files/wireframeiteration4.jpg)). The final version [can be found here](http://www.sciencemag.org/journals).

A project we recently launched was to bring our old Webinar site into the redesign. We started by workshopping our wireframes and sketches with the stakeholders and addressed specific business concerns throughout. You can see our [various page layouts in this PDF file](../files/Webinar_Page_Wireframes_Copy.pdf). [The final version](http://www.sciencemag.org/custom-publishing/webinars), which launched this past week, sticks to the blueprint for the most part, with a few minor modifications and the deft application of our pattern library.

I've also assisted our server/back-end team with [process diagrams](../files/Journal_Importer_Process_Diagram.pdf) and [helpful charts](../files/Sciencemag.org_System_Diagram.pdf) that can sell our vision to other members of the organization.

## Content Strategy

In one of my first tasks for *Science* magazine, I began the difficult task of sorting through much of our static content and trying to find ways to assess, categorize and organize it.

I started by gathering just a few files and [breaking them out into a reasonable taxonomy (.xlsx)](../files/Proposed_Taxonomy_Sections_-_Breakdown.xlsx). From there, I gathered more pages and began to assess them by [recency, relevance and redundancy (.xlsx)](../files/Untitled_spreadsheet.xlsx). Over time, the spreadsheet grew [a little too unwieldy](../files/Filemanager_Content_Inventory_-_Stakeholder_Review.xlsx), owing to an increased level of stakeholder input.

For future content audits, I prefer [this style and approach](../files/Content_Audit_Sheet.xlsx). The focus stays on the importance for business and the efficacy of the current user flow.

I've also written [accessibility reviews](../files/AccessibilityTestResults.pdf) and have encouraged the use of [accessibility profiles](https://uxmag.com/articles/book-excerpt-a-web-for-everyone) that serve in conjunction with our user personae. These were created for the book [*A Web for Everyone*](https://www.amazon.com/Web-Everyone-Designing-Accessible-Experiences/dp/1933820977) and they've informed a number of our design decisions. The standard user personae we lean on were created at the beginning of our redesign project and are in need of a re-do. My supervisor and I are focusing on new metrics and new information about our "average users".
